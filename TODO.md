# Plans

- [ ] Move files to the trash with the `delete` key, and undo the operations with `ctrl-z` / `ctrl-u`.
- [ ] Support deleting empty directories by being in them and pressing `delete`. Should also be undoable.
- [ ] Easter egg support (`game` or konami code).
- [ ] If a directory has hidden files, show `show hidden files with ctrl-h`.
